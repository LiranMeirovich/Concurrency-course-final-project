the project runs by splitting the strings to 2, one half runs by cuda and the other in MPI+OMP. we think its fair, as its 2 different devices working on it (GPU and CPU)


the project runtime when compared to the sequential is about ~10x faster, with the following limitations:

the cuda initiation itself takes around 0.1~ seconds. that alone makes the project run slower than the sequential, 
except when the string count is in the tens of thousands.

this doesn't include the time it takes the MPI to send the input to its processes, because that too, alone, takes >0.01 seconds, which again makes it only good with 1k+ strings.
